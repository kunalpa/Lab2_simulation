# Lab2

A super simple simulation of Squidward sitting in the middle of a screen. Every time Spongebob and Patrick collide with Squidward, he loses a life displayed in the top right corner of the screen.

### Project Structure
* This project utilizes an MVC structure.
* One part of this project that I was particularly proud of was the logic I implemented to remove the background of a given image using Python. This script takes the four corners of an image and runs an iterative dfs on them removing all connected pixels that appear white. These new images were used in the simulation.

### Next steps
* The next step is to gamify this simulation to allow Squidward to evade Spongebob and Patrick asynchronously. The user's goal is to keep at least 1 heart for as long as possible. This will be completed within the next week or so.
